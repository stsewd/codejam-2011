This repository contains solutions to problems of the [code-jam](https://www.devsucodejam.com/) (2011) contest.

All solutions are in Rust because I'm learning Rust,
and solving problems is a funny way of learning a new language ðŸ˜ƒ.

Solutions to each problem with tests are in `src/bin/{problem number}`.
